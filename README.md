## What I originally wanted to make was a dashboard that would
act like a main hub mostly. Meaning, I could make a site that
would act as my homepage. I would set it as my main page on bootup & from there I can jump into any project or begin researching something. Of course this is a very rough draft of that, as I wanted to add alot more features. I will keep updating this project, & as you can see below, here is what is intended to happen.

## So first in red, I plan on adding an in real time stock ticker. This has proven more difficult than first originally imagined as Im not sure if public stock tickers are an API anymore since Yahoo Finance stopped support for theirs some years ago. Still, it would be a nice feature to add, aswell as for crypto coins aswell.

Next up in Green, I planned on having a sticky notes web app that would serve as a way to list small notes either in bullet point form or otherwise. So you can add or subtract to these notes as you wish. I also intended for you to be able to place them anywhere on the screen ! that would be cool. a way so that you stay on track of what needs to get done. 

In turquoise, you see my name which servers as a placeholder, well upon launch, the system will ask for your name & it will save that to your systems memory aswell as some links you would like to add to the side which gets me to my next point

In purple, will be a list of quick access links, upon bootup for the first time the systme will ask you for up to 10 links that you can add to a quick access side panel, so from this mainhub you can quickly startup your github aswell as your youtube to watch funny videos, if you so choose.

in yellow, below the navigation bar but above the randomized quote of the day i would love to add a news feature. So it would display top headlines from around the world, you can select a topic to focus on, such as tech, business or crypto. 

And finally in blue, in addition to just showng the current weather for where you are at, i would like to add a 5 day forecast aswell, so that if you are setting up or planning meetings with others, you can get a quick peek into the future & what to expect on those days. 


## This is still a work in progress & many more quality of life features will be coming soon ! stay tuned !
